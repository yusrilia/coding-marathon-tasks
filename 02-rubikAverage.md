Walking into her room after a tiring day, Avery saw her old Rubik's cube which she hadn't solved in a while. Feeling bored, she decided to solve it. After several rounds of play, she decided to calculate the average time it took to solve the Rubik's cube.

Given an array of times it took Avery to solve the Rubik's cube, `times`, and an integer `n` representing the round that she decided to start counting, return the average time after the `n`th round, rounded to three decimal places.

__Example:__
For:
```
time = [43.1, 48.4, 43.6, 23.8, 20.4, 15.1, 36.5, 19.2]
   n = 2
```
the output should be:
```
26.433
```

__Explanation:__
Avery only counts her time average after her second round (`48.4`). The average of `43.6`, `23.8`, `20.4`, `15.1`, `36.5`,  and `19.2` rounded to three decimal places is `26.433`.
