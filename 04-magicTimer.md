Avery wakes up only to find out that she accidentally fall asleep. She wants to know at what time she falls asleep. Luckily, she has a magic timer in her hand, which started counting when she falls asleep. The timer, however, only counts in seconds.

Given the current time `cur`, and how long Avery has slept in seconds, `sec`, return the time when she accidentally falls asleep.

__Example:__
For
```
cur = "23:07:05"
sec = 10960
```
the output should be: 
```
"20:04:25"
```
