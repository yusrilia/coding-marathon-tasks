Avery safely made it to her parents' house! Rain makes Avery even feels better. She looks at the window, and saw raindrops dripping down the window.

Given an array `window` representing the window Avery was looking at, determine how the window looks like after `time` seconds. Each `#` represents a raindrop. Assume that the rain moves down one unit each second, and stops if it reaches the bottom of the window or a raindrop that is not moving.

__Example:__

For
```
window = ["#  ",
          " ##",
          " # "]
  time = 1
```

the output should be:
```
["   ",
 "## ",
 " ##"]
```
