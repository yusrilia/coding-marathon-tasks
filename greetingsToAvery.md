This marathon is a story about a student named Avery. To start, you decided to greet Avery first. You know that Avery is a multilingual person, so you decided to greet her not only in English, but in other languages too.

Given a two-letters country code, greet Avery with the major language of that country.
You can greet Avery in 8 languages, they are:
| Language| Greeting | Country Code
-------|-------|------
English| `"Hello"`| `"en"`
Indonesian| `"Halo"`|`"id"`
French|`"Bonjour"`|`"fr"`
Spanish| `"Hola"` |`"es"`
Vietnamese |`"Chao"`|`"vn"`
Russian|`"Privet"`|`"ru"`
Deutsch |`"Hallo"`|`"de"`
Hindi |`"Namaste"`|`"in"`

To add enthusiasm, don't forget to end the greeting with an exclamation mark.

__Example:__
For
```
lang = "en"
```
the output should be:
```
 "Hello, Avery!"
```
*(Note: apologize if I wrote the greetings incorrectly in any way)*
